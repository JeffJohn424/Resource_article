# **What is Web 3.0 (Web3)?**
Web 3.0 describes the next evolution of the World Wide Web, the user interface that provides access to documents, applications and multimedia on the internet.
Web 3.0 is still being developed, so there isn't a universally accepted definition. Even the proper spelling isn't nailed down, with analyst firms like Forrester, Gartner and IDC toggling between "Web3" and "Web 3.0."
What is clear, though, is that Web 3.0 will place a strong emphasis on decentralized applications and probably make extensive use of blockchain-based technologies. It will also use machine learning and AI to empower a more intelligent and adaptive web.  

# **Evolution of the web**
If it comes to pass, Web 3.0 will be the successor to two previous generations of the web.  

The first generation, referred to as Web 1.0, was invented in 1989 by Tim Berners-Lee, a British computer scientist who applied the hypertext concepts for linking digital text proposed in 1963 by Ted Nelson, an American information technology pioneer. Besides programming the first browser, Berners-Lee wrote the Hypertext Markup Language (HTML), which tells browsers how to display content, as well as the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) specifying how web servers transfer files to browsers. He also started designing software for a "Semantic Web" that would link data across web pages, but hardware constraints prevented its implementation.  

Around the turn of the millennium, experts began promoting the idea of an upgraded web that would be more interactive, calling it Web 2.0. They started referring to the existing web of basic connectivity to mostly static websites as Web 1.0. Berners-Lee fleshed out his Semantic Web concept by co-authoring an article in Scientific American. Publisher Tim O'Reilly helped promote Web 2.0 by starting a conference dedicated to it.

# **Why is Web 3.0 important?**  
Web 2.0 giants like Amazon, Google and Facebook parent Meta grew quickly by collecting and centralizing petabytes of customer data and monetizing it in myriad ways. Web 3.0's global peer-to-peer network could be the great leveler that makes it hard for such companies to grow by hoarding data. Individuals will have more control over web content and who can access and profit from their personal data.  

Web 3.0 business opportunities, by contrast, are likely to center around exploiting this new ability to tailor web products and services to the individual. For example, Web 3.0 marketing capabilities could help companies strike a better balance between privacy and personalization than is possible with today's web. The downside: They may find Web 3.0's strong privacy protections a barrier to how they already do digital marketing. 

# **Web 3.0 use cases and applications**
Web 3.0 use cases are expected to draw heavily on the web's emerging, AI-driven ability to understand users' intentions and preferences and tailor the content it delivers to them based on personal data that the users control. Much of the content will be automatically curated and delivered, saving companies time and money.  
With blockchain at its foundation, Web 3.0 will enable new applications and services based on blockchain technologies in active use today. They include the following:  

*1. NFTs.* Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) are a type of unique cryptographic asset used to create and authenticate ownership of digital assets. NFTs will be important in how things of value are created and exchanged on Web 3.0.

*2. DeFi.* Decentralized finance (DeFi) is an emerging blockchain technology that could be the basis for Web 3.0's decentralized financial services.  

*3. Cryptocurrency.* Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin are blockchain-based digital currencies that use cryptography to secure the processes involved in generating monetary units, conducting transactions and verifying changes of ownership. Crypto will be the Web 3.0 coin of the realm, according to supporters.  

*4. dApps.* Decentralized applications (dApps) are open source applications built on decentralized blockchains. They can be augmented by others, with a record of such changes recorded on the blockchain's distributed ledger. There are already dApps for middleware, charitable donations and social media platforms, among thousands of others.  

*5. Smart contracts.* A type of dApp, the smart contract is already the basis for emerging blockchain applications and is expected to play a central role in Web 3.0. Smart contracts execute business logic in response to events. They're program code, not contracts in the legal sense -- their legal status has yet to be determined in most jurisdictions -- but they're more responsive to changing conditions than traditional contracts. They'll be powerful Web 3.0 mechanisms for blockchain users and apps to interact in trusted ways.  

*6.Cross-chain bridges.* Blockchains will be numerous in the Web 3.0 world, and enabling a degree of interoperability across them is the purpose of cross-chain bridges.  

*7.DAOs.* DAOs could be the organizing entities that provide the structure and governance needed to make a decentralized approach to Web 3.0 services practical.

# **Risks or downsides of Web 3.0**
The lack of centralized gatekeepers in Web 3.0 could pose a significant risk to users. While Web 3.0â€™s decentralized ownership is seen to empower individuals, the lack of oversight can increase consumer risk, as was seen in the collapse of the major cryptocurrency exchange FTX.  
Decentralization could make regulating Web 3.0 virtually impossible. And with the rapid increase of the amount of information stored on the web and additional interactions and transactions, unauthorized access to personal data could have devastating consequences.  
There will also be new types of cyber attacks to contend with. Ice fishing and other FinTech hacks already exist, and novel cybersecurity threats will continue to emerge. More generally, widespread data manipulation could lead to disinformation. If all users are anonymous in the new world, this includes those with bad intentions. Holding people accountable for attacks and data manipulation will become even more complicated.  
Aside from security threats, Web 3.0 consumes a lot of energy resources due to its reliance on blockchain technology. Mining cryptocurrency, DeFi transactions, and the decentralization of data require a huge amount of power to operate, which will put even more stress on global energy systems.
